# Infinite-Hotel-Explanation
Simple code example that serves as a tool to help explain the infinite hotel paradox.

Each time the code runs, a new guest that was not in any of the "hotel rooms" is added, in relation to the guests that already have a room.

Each row represents a guest. If you edit the .txt strings, a new guest is added taking that into account.
(As for now, not limiting string size)
